### miapp Deployment Guide

#### Overview
This project uses `App.js` to generate static files for the frontend UI (in a node environment). Ensure that the static files are correctly generated and referenced during production. 

Place your generated static files in this directory (/templates or another relevant folder) and run the application

#### Steps to Prepare for Deployment

1. **Generate Static Files**  
   Run the following command to build the static files for the frontend UI:  

   ```sh
   npm run build --force
   ```

2. **Adjust Paths for Production**  
   - Update the path to the generated static files to match the production environment.  
   - Ensure Nginx or any other web server correctly references these static assets.  

3. **Deploy to Server**  
   - Set up a virtual environment for backend dependencies.  
   - Configure Nginx or another server to serve static files efficiently.  

#### Notes
- Double-check the file paths in your configuration to avoid broken links.  
- Test the deployment to confirm that all static assets are being served properly.
